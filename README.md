# DAT325

For a school project, I cleaned a data set and performed data validation using Excel. I reconciled the count of rows in each table to ensure the number of rows I inserted made it into the merged table.

I used the identified variable for my data set to determine the MIN, MAX, and AVERAGE of the data within my table using Excel. I obtained the MIN, MAX, and AVERAGE of the imported data, existing data, and merged data. 

Using validation within my dataset helped guarantee that the data is of highest quality and accuracy in its final form. Validation makes sure that every column is the exact way we intend it to be and lets us know of any errors that could still be remaining even after cleaning the data. Using the validation steps is similar to having another pair of eyes check over your work to make sure nothing was missed especially with datasets it can be easy to miss something just because there is so much to look at.
